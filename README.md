# Abstract
Different models can be used to build a machine learning system capable of
performing a character classification task. One of the classification tasks most often
used as a benchmark for classification models is character recognition. This report
describes a comparison among these different models, trained on a dataset of
modern greek handwritten letters, with different hyperparameters and optimization
features. It is well known that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) perform the
best in image classification tasks, however, reaching high accuracy scores also
requires hyperparameter tuning and strategies to solve high variance. Using these
optimizations, the best model trained in the experiments reaches an accuracy score
of up to 94%.
